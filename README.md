# ChadBot-X
We ought to be playing punch out because this is round 2

Second attempt at creating a TAS bot for the NES in under 24 hours at a hackathon.

# Results

Ended up working but only after very particular configuration; Could not get it to work on boot, causing desyncs after the first level.
